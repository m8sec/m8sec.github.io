My name is Mike, I go by [@m8sec](https://twitter.com/m8sec) on the internet. I work as an offensive security manager leading a wide range of engagements against client environments. In my spare time I create blog posts and write code relating to hacking. I've authored a number of tools including [SubScraper](https://github.com/m8sec/subscraper), [CrossLinked](https://github.com/m8sec/CrossLinked), and [nullinux](https://github.com/m8sec/nullinux).

This site is used as a place to post random research, write-ups, and whatever else I may be working on - not found on [Medium](https://m8sec.medium.com/). Want to collaborate, talk, or get in touch? Don't be afraid to reach out!
